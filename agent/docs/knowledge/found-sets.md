# Found Sets

**NOTE:** Items marked with **(step)** are script steps. Items marked with **(function)** are calculation functions used inside expressions. This distinction matters: script steps become `<Step>` elements in fmxmlsnippet output, while functions appear inside `<Calculation><![CDATA[...]]></Calculation>` blocks.

## Attributes of Found Sets

- A Found Set is a list of specific records.
- `Perform Find` **(step)** can create a found set or empty set.
- New records from any client are not added to any other client's Found Set.
- Record deletions do impact the found set for all clients.
- `Constrain Found Set` **(step)** & `Extend Found Set` **(step)** preserve any applied sort order.
- A zero-record found set based on `Perform Find` removes the previous sort order.
- A `New Window` **(step)** will retain a copy of the same found set and sort order. The new window's found set is independent — constraining or extending in one window does not affect the other.

## Empty finds and error 401

`Perform Find` **(step)** can return error 401 when no records match, while
leaving a valid empty found set. Treat that as a normal result when the
business task allows zero matches. Under the project error framework, capture
the native result immediately when it affects control flow, but do not create
an application error with `Error.Make` or log solely because the set is empty.
If a match is required, report an application error; if continuing after the
expected 401, clear the captured native error before later work.

## Multi-user behavior

The asymmetry between record creation and deletion in a multi-user environment is important to account for in scripts:

- **Record creation:** A new record created by any client is _not_ added to any other client's found set. Other clients must re-find or extend their found set to see new records.
- **Record deletion:** A deleted record _is_ removed from every client's found set. Scripts that loop through records should account for the possibility that `Get ( FoundCount )` may decrease mid-loop if another user deletes a record.

## Actions that operate on a Found Set

### Script steps

- `Loop` **(step)** — iterate through records using `Go to Record/Request/Page [ Next ; Exit after last: On ]`.
- `Replace Field Contents` **(step)** — apply a calculation or serial number to a field across all records in the found set.
- `Delete All Records` **(step)** — delete every record in the found set, with or without a dialog prompt.
- `Check Found Set` **(step)** — check spelling in all fields of all records.
- `Relookup Field Contents` **(step)** — re-trigger the lookup defined on a relationship for all records.
- `Send Mail` **(step)** — has an option titled "Multiple emails (one for each record in found set)".
- `Copy All Records/Requests` **(step)** — copies tab-delimited data from all fields shown on the layout for the current found set to the clipboard.
- `Import Records` **(step)** — the Update and Replace options operate only on the current found set.
- `Export Records` **(step)** — exports the current found set.
- `Save Records as Snapshot Link` **(step)** — when using _Records being browsed_, outputs a snapshot link file to any path (see example below).

### Calculation functions

- `GetSummary ( summaryField ; breakField )` **(function)** — returns aggregate values from summary fields across the found set.
- `GetNthRecord ( field ; recordNumber )` **(function)** — returns a field value from a specific record number in the found set. Can be used with a `Loop` or `While ( [ initialVariable ] ; condition ; [ logic ] ; result )`.
- `GetRecordIDsFromFoundSet ( type )` **(function)** — returns internal record IDs for the found set. The `type` parameter controls the format.

## Methods of collecting values from the Found Set

There are three common approaches, each with different trade-offs:

### 1. Loop (most flexible, slowest on large sets)

A record loop collects field values into a `$variable` or field one record at a time.

### 2. Summary field + GetSummary (no scripting required) (preferred)

If the table has a Summary field using the **List of** type, the `GetSummary ( summaryField ; breakField )` function returns the aggregated values. This evaluates without looping.

### 3. Replace Field Contents + List()

This technique uses `Replace Field Contents` with a calculation to accumulate values across all records in a single pass. It requires a global text field as an accumulator.

```
Set Field [ Table::GLOBAL_FIELD ; "" ]
Replace Field Contents [ With dialog: Off ; Table::GLOBAL_FIELD ; List ( Table::GLOBAL_FIELD ; Table::PrimaryKey ) ; Skip auto-enter options ]
```

## Restoring a Found Set

There are multiple methods for restoring a found set.

### Old method (relationship-based)

A list of key values stored in a global or record-local text field can drive a relationship (text field -> indexed field) in combination with `Go to Related Record` **(step)**. This can target the same window or a new window. Using a normal text field persists across sessions; using a global text field does not.

### New method (Go to List of Records)

`Go to List of Records` **(step)** restores a found set from a list of record IDs. The IDs can be stored in:

| Storage           | Scope                       | Persists across sessions |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `$variable`       | Current script only         | No                       |
| `$$GLOBAL`        | Any script in the session   | No                       |
| Global text field | Any script in the session   | No                       |
| Normal text field | Stored on a specific record | Yes                      |

```
Set Variable [ $ids ; Value: GetRecordIDsFromFoundSet ( 0 ) ]
Go to List of Records [ List of record IDs: $ids ; Using layout: <Current Layout> ; Animation: None ]
```

## Example Snapshot Link XML

The snapshot link includes the record IDs as ranges within the `<Rows>` tag.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<FPSL>
  <UIState>
    <UniversalPathList>filemac:/Drive/Users/name/Desktop/Invoice Solution.fmp12
    fmnet:/127.0.0.1/Invoice Solution.fmp12
    fmnet:/127.0.0.1/Invoice Solution.fmp12</UniversalPathList>
    <Rows type="nativeIDList" rowCount="5" baseTableId="134">
<![CDATA[28-30
32-33
]]>
    </Rows>
    <Layout id="34"></Layout>
    <View type="form"></View>
    <SelectedRow type="nativeID" id="28"></SelectedRow>
    <StatusToolbar visible="True"></StatusToolbar>
    <Mode value="browseMode"></Mode>
    <SortList Maintain="True" value="True">
      <Sort type="Ascending">
        <PrimaryField>
          <Field tableId="1065094" table="Invoices" id="35" name="Client Name"></Field>
        </PrimaryField>
      </Sort>
    </SortList>
  </UIState>
</FPSL>
```
